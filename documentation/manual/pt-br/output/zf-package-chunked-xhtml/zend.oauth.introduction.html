    <p class="para">
        OAuth allows you to approve access by any application to your private data stored a website
        without being forced to disclose your username or password. If you think about it, the
        practice of handing over your username and password for sites like Yahoo Mail or Twitter has
        been endemic for quite a while. This has raised some serious concerns because there&#039;s
        nothing to prevent other applications from misusing this data. Yes, some services may
        appear trustworthy but that is never guaranteed. OAuth resolves this problem by eliminating
        the need for any username and password sharing, replacing it with a user controlled
        authorization process.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        This authorization process is token based. If you authorize an application (and by
        application we can include any web based or desktop application) to access your data, it
        will be in receipt of an Access Token associated with your account. Using this Access Token,
        the application can access your private data without continually requiring your credentials.
        In all this authorization delegation style of protocol is simply a more secure solution to
        the problem of accessing private data via any web service <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        OAuth is not a completely new idea, rather it is a standardized protocol building on the
        existing properties of protocols such as Google AuthSub, Yahoo BBAuth, Flickr
        <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>, etc. These all to some extent operate on the basis of exchanging
        user credentials for an Access Token of some description. The power of a standardized
        specification like OAuth is that it only requires a single implementation as opposed to many
        disparate ones depending on the web service. This standardization has not occurred
        independently of the major players, and indeed many now support OAuth as an alternative and
        future replacement for their own solutions.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Zend Framework&#039;s <span class="classname">Zend_Oauth</span> currently implements a full OAuth
        Consumer conforming to the OAuth Core 1.0 Revision A Specification (24 June 2009) via the
        <span class="classname">Zend_Oauth_Consumer</span> class.
    </p>

    <div class="section" id="zend.oauth.introduction.protocol-workflow" name="zend.oauth.introduction.protocol-workflow"><div class="info"><h1 class="title">Protocol Workflow</h1></div>
    

    <p class="para">
        Before implementing OAuth it makes sense to understand how the protocol operates. To do so
        we&#039;ll take the example of Twitter which currently implements OAuth based on the OAuth Core
        1.0 Revision A Specification. This example looks at the protocol from the perspectives of
        the User (who will approve access), the Consumer (who is seeking access) and the Provider
        (who holds the User&#039;s private data). Access may be read-only or read and write.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        By chance, our User has decided that they want to utilise a new service called TweetExpress
        which claims to be capable of reposting your blog posts to Twitter in a manner of seconds.
        TweetExpress is a registered application on Twitter meaning that it has access to a Consumer
        Key and a Consumer Secret (all OAuth applications must have these from the Provider they
        will be accessing) which identify its requests to Twitter and that ensure all requests can
        be signed using the Consumer Secret to verify their origin.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        To use TweetExpress you are asked to register for a new account, and after your registration
        is confirmed you are informed that TweetExpress will seek to associate your Twitter account
        with the service.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        In the meantime TweetExpress has been busy. Before gaining your approval from Twitter, it
        has sent a <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym> request to Twitter&#039;s service asking for a new
        unauthorized Request Token. This token is not User specific from Twitter&#039;s perspective, but
        TweetExpress may use it specifically for the current User and should associate it with their
        account and store it for future use. TweetExpress now redirects the User to Twitter so they
        can approve TweetExpress&#039; access. The URL for this redirect will be signed using
        TweetExpress&#039; Consumer Secret and it will contain the unauthorized Request Token as a
        parameter.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        At this point the User may be asked to log into Twitter and will now be faced with a Twitter
        screen asking if they approve this request by TweetExpress to access Twitter&#039;s
        <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> on the User&#039;s behalf. Twitter will record the response which we&#039;ll
        assume was positive. Based on the User&#039;s approval, Twitter will record the current
        unauthorized Request Token as having been approved by the User (thus making it User
        specific) and will generate a new value in the form of a verification code. The User is now
        redirected back to a specific callback URL used by TweetExpress (this callback URL may be
        registered with Twitter or dynamically set using an oauth_callback parameter in requests).
        The redirect URL will contain the newly generated verification code.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        TweetExpress&#039; callback URL will trigger an examination of the response to determine whether
        the User has granted their approval to Twitter. Assuming so, it may now exchange it&#039;s
        unauthorized Request Token for a fully authorized Access Token by sending a request back to
        Twitter including the Request Token and the received verification code. Twitter should now
        send back a response containing this Access Token which must be used in all requests used to
        access Twitter&#039;s <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> on behalf of the User. Twitter will only do this
        once they have confirmed the attached Request Token has not already been used to retrieve
        another Access Token. At this point, TweetExpress may confirm the receipt of the approval to
        the User and delete the original Request Token which is no longer needed.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        From this point forward, TweetExpress may use Twitter&#039;s <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> to post new
        tweets on the User&#039;s behalf simply by accessing the <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> endpoints with a
        request that has been digitally signed (via HMAC-SHA1) with a combination of TweetExpress&#039;
        Consumer Secret and the Access Key being used.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Although Twitter do not currently expire Access Tokens, the User is free to deauthorize
        TweetExpress from their Twitter account settings. Once deauthorized, TweetExpress&#039; access
        will be cut off and their Access Token rendered invalid.

    <div class="section" id="zend.oauth.introduction.security-architecture" name="zend.oauth.introduction.security-architecture"><div class="info"><h1 class="title">Security Architecture</h1></div>
    

    <p class="para">
        OAuth was designed specifically to operate over an insecure <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym>
        connection and so the use of <acronym class="acronym">HTTPS</acronym> is not required though obviously it
        would be desireable if available. Should a <acronym class="acronym">HTTPS</acronym> connection be feasible,
        OAuth offers a signature method implementation called PLAINTEXT which may be utilised. Over
        a typical unsecured <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym> connection, the use of PLAINTEXT must be avoided
        and an alternate scheme using. The OAuth specification defines two such signature methods:
        HMAC-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1. Both are fully supported by <span class="classname">Zend_Oauth</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        These signature methods are quite easy to understand. As you can imagine, a PLAINTEXT
        signature method does nothing that bears mentioning since it relies on
        <acronym class="acronym">HTTPS</acronym>. If you were to use PLAINTEXT over <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym>, you are
        left with a significant problem: there&#039;s no way to be sure that the content of any OAuth
        enabled request (which would include the OAuth Access Token) was altered en route. This is
        because unsecured <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym> requests are always at risk of eavesdropping, Man
        In The Middle (MITM) attacks, or other risks whereby a request can be retooled so to speak
        to perform tasks on behalf of the attacker by masquerading as the origin application without
        being noticed by the service provider.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        HMAC-SHA1 and RSA-SHA1 alleviate this risk by digitally signing all OAuth requests with the
        original application&#039;s registered Consumer Secret. Assuming only the Consumer and the
        Provider know what this secret is, a middle-man can alter requests all they wish - but they
        will not be able to validly sign them and unsigned or invalidly signed requests would be
        discarded by both parties. Digital signatures therefore offer a guarantee that validly
        signed requests do come from the expected party and have not been altered en route. This is
        the core of why OAuth can operate over an unsecure connection.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        How these digital signatures operate depends on the method used, i.e. HMAC-SHA1, RSA-SHA1 or
        perhaps another method defined by the service provider. HMAC-SHA1 is a simple mechanism
        which generates a Message Authentication Code (MAC) using a cryptographic hash function
        (i.e. SHA1) in combination with a secret key known only to the message sender and receiver
        (i.e. the OAuth Consumer Secret and the authorized Access Key combined). This hashing
        mechanism is applied to the parameters and content of any OAuth requests which are
        concatenated into a &quot;base signature string&quot; as defined by the OAuth specification.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        RSA-SHA1 operates on similar principles except that the shared secret is, as you would
        expect, each parties&#039; RSA private key. Both sides would have the other&#039;s public key with
        which to verify digital signatures. This does pose a level of risk compared to HMAC-SHA1
        since the RSA method does not use the Access Key as part of the shared secret. This means
        that if the RSA private key of any Consumer is compromised, then all Access Tokens assigned
        to that Consumer are also. RSA imposes an all or nothing scheme. In general, the majority of
        service providers offering OAuth authorization have therefore tended to use HMAC-SHA1 by
        default, and those who offer RSA-SHA1 may offer fallback support to HMAC-SHA1.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        While digital signatures add to OAuth&#039;s security they are still vulnerable to other forms of
        attack, such as replay attacks which copy earlier requests which were intercepted and
        validly signed at that time. An attacker can now resend the exact same request to a
        Provider at will at any time and intercept its results. This poses a significant risk but it
        is quiet simple to defend against - add a unique string (i.e. a nonce) to all requests which
        changes per request (thus continually changing the signature string) but which can never be
        reused because Providers actively track used nonces within the a certain window defined by
        the timestamp also attached to a request. You might first suspect that once you stop
        tracking a particular nonce, the replay could work but this ignore the timestamp which can
        be used to determine a request&#039;s age at the time it was validly signed. One can assume that
        a week old request used in an attempted replay should be summarily discarded!
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        As a final point, this is not an exhaustive look at the security architecture in OAuth. For
        example, what if <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym> requests which contain both the Access Token and
        the Consumer Secret are eavesdropped? The system relies on at one in the clear transmission
        of each unless <acronym class="acronym">HTTPS</acronym> is active, so the obvious conclusion is that where
        feasible <acronym class="acronym">HTTPS</acronym> is to be preferred leaving unsecured
        <acronym class="acronym">HTTP</acronym> in place only where it is not possible or affordable to do so.

        With the OAuth protocol explained, let&#039;s show a simple example of it with
        source code. Our new Consumer will be handling Twitter Status submissions.
        To do so, it will need to be registered with Twitter in order to receive
        an OAuth Consumer Key and Consumer Secret. This are utilised to obtain
        an Access Token before we use the Twitter <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> to post a status message.

    <p class="para">
        The callbackUrl is the URI we want Twitter to request from our server
        when sending information. We&#039;ll look at this later. The siteUrl is the
        base URI of Twitter&#039;s OAuth <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym> endpoints. The full list of endpoints
        include http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token, http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token,
        and http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize. The base siteUrl utilises a convention
        which maps to these three OAuth endpoints (as standard) for requesting a
        request token, access token or authorization. If the actual endpoints of
        any service differ from the standard set, these three URIs can be separately
        set using the methods  <span class="methodname">setRequestTokenUrl()</span>,
         <span class="methodname">setAccessTokenUrl()</span>,
        and  <span class="methodname">setAuthorizeUrl()</span> or the configuration fields requestTokenUrl,
        accessTokenUrl and authorizeUrl.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        The consumerKey and consumerSecret are retrieved from Twitter when your
        application is registered for OAuth access. These also apply to any OAuth
        enabled service, so each one will provide a key and secret for your
        application.

        All of these configuration options may be set using method calls simply
        by converting from, e.g. callbackUrl to setCallbackUrl().

    <p class="para">
        In addition, you should note several other configuration values not
        explicitly used: requestMethod and requestScheme. By default,
        <span class="classname">Zend_Oauth_Consumer</span> sends requests as POST (except for a
        redirect which uses <b><tt>GET</tt></b>). The customised client (see later) also
        includes its authorization by way of a header. Some services may, at their discretion,
        require alternatives. You can reset the requestMethod (which defaults
        to Zend_Oauth::POST) to Zend_Oauth::GET, for example, and reset the
        requestScheme from its default of Zend_Oauth::REQUEST_SCHEME_HEADER to one
        of Zend_Oauth::REQUEST_SCHEME_POSTBODY or
        Zend_Oauth::REQUEST_SCHEME_QUERYSTRING. Typically the defaults should work
        fine apart from some exceptional cases. Please refer to the service provider&#039;s
        documentation for more details.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        The second area of customisation is how <acronym class="acronym">HMAC</acronym> operates
        when calculating/comparing them for all requests. This is configured using
        the signatureMethod configuration field or  <span class="methodname">setSignatureMethod()
        </span>. By default this is HMAC-SHA1. You can set it also to a provider&#039;s
        preferred method including RSA-SHA1. For RSA-SHA1, you should also configure
        RSA private and public keys via the rsaPrivateKey and rsaPublicKey configuration
        fields or the  <span class="methodname">setRsaPrivateKey()</span> and
         <span class="methodname">setRsaPublicKey()</span> methods.

    <p class="para">
        The user will now be redirected to Twitter. They will be asked to authorize
        the request token attached to the redirect URI&#039;s query string. Assuming they
        agree, and complete the authorization, they will be again redirected, this
        time to our Callback URL as previously set (note that the callback URL is
        also registered with Twitter when we registered our application).
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        Before redirecting the user, we should persist the request token to storage.
        For simplicity I&#039;m just using the user&#039;s session, but you can easily use a
        database for the same purpose, so long as you tie the request token to the
        current user so it can be retrieved when they return to our application.
    </p>

    <p class="para">
        The redirect URI from Twitter will contain an authorized Access Token. We
        can include code to parse out this access token as follows - this source
        code would exist within the executed code of our callback URI. Once parsed
        we can discard the previous request token, and instead persist the access
        token for future use with the Twitter <acronym class="acronym">API</acronym>. Again, we&#039;re simply persisting
        to the user session, but in reality an access token can have a long lifetime
        so it should really be stored to a database.
