        <p class="para">
            You should decide which Adapter you want to use for
            <span class="classname">Zend_Translate</span>. Frequently, external criteria such as a project
            requirement or a customer requirement determines this for you, but if you are in
            the position to do this yourself, the following hints may simplify
            your decision.
        </p>

        <blockquote><p><b class="note">Note</b>: 
            
                When deciding your adapter you should also be aware of the used
                encoding. Even if Zend Framework declares UTF-8 as default
                encoding you will sometimes be in the need of other encoding.
                <span class="classname">Zend_Translate</span> will not change any encoding which is defined
                within the source file which means that if your Gettext source
                is build upon ISO-8859-1 it will also return strings in this encoding
                without converting them. There is only one restriction:
            <br />

            
                When you use a <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> based source format like TMX or XLIFF you must
                define the encoding within the <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> files header because
                <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> files without defined encoding will be treated as UTF-8 by
                any <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> parser by default. You should also be aware that actually
                the encoding of <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> files is limited to the encodings supported
                by <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> which are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1 and US-ASCII.

            <p class="para">
                The Array Adapter is the Adapter which is simplest to use for
                programmers.
                But when you have numerous translation strings or many
                languages you should think about another Adapter.
                For example, if you have 5000 translation strings,
                the Array Adapter is possibly not the best choice for you.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                You should only use this Adapter for small sites with a handful
                of languages, and if you or your programmer team creates the
                translations yourselves.

            <p class="para">
                The Csv Adapter is the Adapter which is simplest to use for
                customers.
                CSV files are readable by standard text editors, but
                text editors often do not support utf8 character sets.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                You should only use this Adapter if your customer wants to do
                translations himself.
            </p>

            <blockquote><p><b class="note">Note</b>: 
                
                    Beware that the Csv Adapter has problems when your Csv files are encoded
                    differently than the locale setting of your environment. This is due to a Bug of
                    <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> itself which will not be fixed before
                    <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> 6.0 (http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=38471). So you should
                    be aware that the Csv Adapter due to <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> restrictions is not
                    locale aware.

            <p class="para">
                The Gettext Adapter is the Adapter which is used most
                frequently. Gettext is a translation source format which was
                introduced by GNU, and is now used worldwide.
                It is not human readable, but there are several freeware tools
                (for instance, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/poedit/" class="link external">&raquo; POEdit</a>),
                which are very helpful. The <span class="classname">Zend_Translate</span> Gettext Adapter is
                not implemented using <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym>&#039;s gettext extension.
                You can use the Gettext Adapter even if you do not have
                the <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> gettext extension installed.
                Also the Adapter is thread-safe and the <acronym class="acronym">PHP</acronym> gettext extension
                is currently not thread-safe.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                Most people will use this adapter.
                With the available tools, professional translation is
                very simple. But gettext data are is stored in a
                machine-readable format, which is not readable without tools.

            <p class="para">
                The Ini Adapter is a very simple Adapter which can even be used
                directly by customers.
                <acronym class="acronym">INI</acronym> files are readable by standard text editors, but
                text editors often do not support utf8 character sets.
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                You should only use this Adapter when your customer wants to do translations
                himself. Do not use this adapter as generic translation source.

                system-independent.

                The XmlTm Adapter is the Adapter which will be used by customers
                which do their layout themself. XmlTm is a format which allows the
                complete <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> source to be included in the translation source, so
                the translation is coupled with the layout.
                XLIFF is a <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> file based format, which is related to XLIFF but
                its not as simple to read.

            <p class="para">
                This adapter should only be used when source files already exist.

            <span class="classname">Zend_Translate_Adapter</span> is an abstract class which already defines
            all what is needed for translation. What has to be done by you, is the definition of the

            The usage of the prefix &quot;Zend&quot; should be limited to Zend Framework.
