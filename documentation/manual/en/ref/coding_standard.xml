                This document provides guidelines for code formatting and documentation to
                individuals and teams contributing to Zend Framework. Many developers using Zend
                Framework have also found these coding standards useful because their code's style
                remains consistent with all Zend Framework code. It is also worth noting that it
                requires significant effort to fully specify coding standards.

                    Sometimes developers consider the establishment of a standard more important
                    than what that standard actually suggests at the most detailed level of
                    design. The guidelines in Zend Framework's coding standards capture practices
                    that have worked well on the Zend Framework project. You may modify these
                    standards or use them as is in accordance with the terms of our <ulink

                Coding standards are important in any development project, but they are particularly
                important when many developers are working on the same project. Coding standards
                help ensure that the code is high quality, has fewer bugs, and can be easily
                maintained.

                The target line length is 80 characters. That is to say, Zend Framework developers

                practical. However, longer lines are acceptable in some circumstances. The maximum

            <para>
                Zend Framework standardizes on a class naming convention whereby the names of the
                classes directly map to the directories in which they are stored. The root level
                directory of Zend Framework's standard library is the "Zend/" directory, whereas
                the root level directory of Zend Framework's extras library is the "ZendX/"
                directory. All Zend Framework classes are stored hierarchically under these root
                directories..
            </para>

            <para>
                Class names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Numbers are permitted
                in class names but are discouraged in most cases. Underscores are only permitted in
                place of the path separator; the filename "<filename>Zend/Db/Table.php</filename>"
                must map to the class name "<classname>Zend_Db_Table</classname>".
            </para>

            <para>
                If a class name is comprised of more than one word, the first letter of each new
                word must be capitalized. Successive capitalized letters are not allowed, e.g.
                a class "Zend_PDF" is not allowed while "<classname>Zend_Pdf</classname>" is
                acceptable.
            </para>

            <para>
                These conventions define a pseudo-namespace mechanism for Zend Framework. Zend
                Framework will adopt the <acronym>PHP</acronym> namespace feature when it becomes
                available and is feasible for our developers to use in their applications.
            </para>

            <para>
                See the class names in the standard and extras libraries for examples of this
                classname convention.

                    never start with "Zend_" or "ZendX_".

        <sect2 id="coding-standard.naming-conventions.abstracts">
            <title>Abstract Classes</title>

            <para>
                In general, abstract classes follow the same conventions as <link
                    linkend="coding-standard.naming-conventions.classes">classes</link>,
                with one additional rule: abstract class names must end in the term, "Abstract",
                and that term must not be preceded by an underscore. As an example,
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_Abstract</classname> is considered an
                invalid name, but <classname>Zend_Controller_PluginAbstract</classname> or
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_PluginAbstract</classname> would be valid
                names.
            </para>

            <note>
                <para>
                    This naming convention is new with version 1.9.0 of Zend Framework. Classes
                    that pre-date that version may not follow this rule, but will be renamed in
                    the future in order to comply.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The rationale for the change is due to namespace usage. As we look towards Zend
                    Framework 2.0 and usage of <acronym>PHP</acronym> 5.3, we will be using
                    namespaces. The easiest way to automate conversion to namespaces is to simply
                    convert underscores to the namespace separator -- but under the old naming
                    conventions, this leaves the classname as simply "Abstract" or "Interface" --
                    both of which are reserved keywords in <acronym>PHP</acronym>. If we prepend the
                    (sub)component name to the classname, we can avoid these issues.
                </para>

                <para>
                    To illustrate the situation, consider converting the class
                    <classname>Zend_Controller_Request_Abstract</classname> to use namespaces:
                </para>

                <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
namespace Zend\Controller\Request;

abstract class Abstract
{
    // ...
}
]]></programlisting>

                <para>
                    Clearly, this will not work. Under the new naming conventions, however, this
                    would become:
                </para>

                <programlisting language="php"><![CDATA[
namespace Zend\Controller\Request;

abstract class RequestAbstract
{
    // ...
}
]]></programlisting>

                <para>
                    We still retain the semantics and namespace separation, while omitting the
                    keyword issues; simultaneously, it better describes the abstract class.
                </para>
            </note>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 id="coding-standard.naming-conventions.interfaces">
            <title>Interfaces</title>

            <para>
                In general, interfaces follow the same conventions as <link
                    linkend="coding-standard.naming-conventions.classes">classes</link>,
                with one additional rule: interface names may optionally end in the term,
                "Interface", but that term must not be preceded by an underscore. As an example,
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_Interface</classname> is considered an
                invalid name, but <classname>Zend_Controller_PluginInterface</classname> or
                <classname>Zend_Controller_Plugin_PluginInterface</classname> would be valid
                names.
            </para>

            <para>
                While this rule is not required, it is strongly recommended, as it provides a
                good visual cue to developers as to which files contain interfaces rather than
                classes.
            </para>

            <para>
                Any file that contains <acronym>PHP</acronym> code should end with the extension
                "<filename>.php</filename>", with the notable exception of view scripts. The
                following examples show acceptable filenames for Zend Framework classes:

                Function names may only contain alphanumeric characters. Underscores are not

            </para>

            <para>
                Function names must always start with a lowercase letter. When a function name
                consists of more than one word, the first letter of each new word must be
                capitalized. This is commonly called "camelCase" formatting.
            </para>

            <para>
                Verbosity is generally encouraged. Function names should be as verbose as is
                practical to fully describe their purpose and behavior.
            </para>

            <para>
                These are examples of acceptable names for functions:

                For object-oriented programming, accessors for instance or static variables should
                always be prefixed with "get" or "set". In implementing design patterns, such as the
                singleton or factory patterns, the name of the method should contain the pattern
                name where practical to more thoroughly describe behavior.
            </para>

            <para>
                For methods on objects that are declared with the "private" or "protected" modifier,
                the first character of the method name must be an underscore. This is the only
                acceptable application of an underscore in a method name. Methods declared "public"
                should never contain an underscore.
            </para>

                Functions in the global scope (a.k.a "floating functions") are permitted but

                    When a string is literal (contains no variable substitutions), the apostrophe or
                    "single quote" should always be used to demarcate the string:

                    Control statements based on the <emphasis>if</emphasis> and
                    <emphasis>elseif</emphasis> constructs must have a single space before the
                    opening parenthesis of the conditional and a single space after the closing
                    parenthesis.

                <para>
                    Within the conditional statements between the parentheses, operators must be
                    separated by spaces for readability. Inner parentheses are encouraged to improve
                    logical grouping for larger conditional expressions.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The opening brace is written on the same line as the conditional statement. The
                    closing brace is always written on its own line. Any content within the braces
                    must be indented using four spaces.

                <para>
                    If the conditional statement causes the line length to exceed the <link

                        length</link> and has several clauses, you may break the conditional into
                    multiple lines. In such a case, break the line prior to a logic operator, and
                    pad the line such that it aligns under the first character of the conditional
                    clause. The closing paren in the conditional will then be placed on a line with
                    the opening brace, with one space separating the two, at an indentation level
                    equivalent to the opening control statement.

                    The intention of this latter declaration format is to prevent issues when
                    adding or removing clauses from the conditional during later revisions.

                    For "if" statements that include "elseif" or "else", the formatting conventions
                    are similar to the "if" construct. The following examples demonstrate proper
                    formatting for "if" statements with "else" and/or "elseif" constructs:

                        are omitted should contain a comment indicating that the break was
