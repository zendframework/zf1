/**
 * Class for custom messages
 *
 * We want be able to delete messages and we to serialize objects
 * via a getBody() and setBody()
 *
 * This is different that doing the serialization directly next to the object
 * because you may want to update getBody() and setBody() to do a json
 * conversion instead of a php serialize
 *
 * You could also just overload the Zend_Queue::send() and Zend_Queue::receive()
 * functions to do the serialization/json encoding, but I wanted to give an
 * good example that overloaded near everything except for the adapter.
